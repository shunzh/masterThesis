Humans are able to learn and accomplish some complex tasks more efficiently than
reinforcement learning agents. The possibilities are humans have some prior
knowledge on how to accomplish smaller and easier tasks. When they tackle a
complex task, they only need to learn which basic skills they need to use, and
how to combine them.

This thesis is organized as follows. Chapter~\ref{chp:mirl} introduces 
preliminary concepts of reinforcement learning, inverse reinforcement learning,
modular reinforcement learing and describes the proposed algorithm.
Chapter~\ref{chp:lr} reviews the literature on task decomposition in
reinforcement learning. We report our experimental results in
Chapter~\ref{chp:eval} and conclude in Chapter~\ref{chp:conclude}.
